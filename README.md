# Description

Just a todo cards webapp to emulate the copypasta, but in vanilla js. (Maybe Reactivize or Meteorize Later?)

# How to run...

* Use a Linux Container or Host.
* Install nodejs 
* Launch the shell script ./start-webapp.sh (Make sure you know what you are doing)
* Open a web browser to localhost:3000, and upload a file or a note, and it will save those to ./data/files or ./data/notes

# Todo

* need meteorjs reactivity instead of vanilla js
* make bash script for node ./server.js
